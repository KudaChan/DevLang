### __**Print:**__
---
The console allows us to print and view JavaScript output. we can send information to the console using **console.log()**.

For example, this code will print "Naomi" to the console:

```
console.log("Naomi");
```

```
let developer = "Naomi";
console.log(developer);
```

### __**Variable :**__
---
JavaScript is the programming language that powers the web. Unlike the HTML and CSS you have learned previously, JavaScript is most commonly used to write logic instead of markup.

One of the most important concepts in programming is variables. A variable points to a specific memory address that stores a value. Variables are given a name which can be used throughout your code to access that value.

Declaring a variable means giving it a name. In JavaScript, this is often done with the **let** keyword.

For example, here is how we would declare a hello variable:

`let hello;`

we can assign a value using the assignment operator **=**.

For example:

`let character = "Hello";`

When a variable is declared with the **let** keyword, we can reassign (or change the value of) that variable later on.

In this example, the value of programmer is changed from "Naomi" to "CamperChan".

```
let programmer = "Naomi";
programmer = "CamperChan";
```

### __**Data Types:**__
---
JavaScript has seven primitive data types, with **String** being one of them. In JavaScript, a string represents a sequence of characters and can be enclosed in either single (') or double (") quotes.

Note that strings are immutable, which means once they are created, they cannot be changed. The variable can still be reassigned another value.
