                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                    language. Inside a
                    host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
                    environment to provide
                    programmatic control over them.</p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                    language elements
                    such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety
                    of purposes by
                    supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and
                        its Document Object Model
                        (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML
                        form and respond to user
                        events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running
                        JavaScript on a server. For
                        example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide
                        continuity of information
                        from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                    identifiers, conform
                    to certain rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                    characters can also be
                    digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z"
                    (uppercase) and the
                    characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the
                    Unicode escape sequences
                    as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can declare a variable in three ways:
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the keyword var. For example,
                </p>
                <code>
                    var x = 42.
                </code>
                <p>
                    This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By simply assigning it a value. For example,
                </p>
                <code>
                    x = 42.
                </code>
                <p>
                    This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use
                    this variant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the keyword let. For example,
                </p>
                <code>
                    let y = 13.
                </code>
                <p>
                    This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.

            <article>
                <p>
                    The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Six data types that are primitives:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                            <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive,
                                null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                            <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                            <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                            <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                            <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 6). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        and Object
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions
                    with your applications.
                    Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects
                    as named containers for
                    values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.

            <article>

                <p>
                    Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else
                    clause to execute a
                    statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
                </p>
                <code>
                    if (condition) {
                        statement_1;
                    } else {
                        statement_2;
                    }
                </code>
                <p>
                    condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of
                    what evaluates to true
                    and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is
                    executed. statement_1 and
                    statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements.

        <section class="main-section" id="While_Loops">
            <header>While Loops</header>
            <article>

                <p>
                    A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A
                    while statement looks as
                    follows:
                </p>
                <code>
                    while (condition) {
                        statement;
                    }
                </code>
                <p>
                    If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
                    statement following
                    the loop.

                <p>
                    A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the
                    function keyword,
                    followed by:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The name of the function.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:
                </p>
                <code>
                    function square(number) {
                        return number * number;
                    }
                </code>
                <p>
                    The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that
                    says to return the
                    argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies the
                    value returned by the
                    function.
                </p>
                <code>
                    return number number;
                </code>
                <p>
                    Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the
                    function, but if the
                    function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling
                    function.
